# C-Project-
I have created a URL Phishing Detector in C language as a project of my First Semester.

This URL Phishing Detector is a C-based project that helps identify potentially harmful URLs that may lead to phishing sites. It utilizes various algorithms to analyze the structure of the URL and detect common patterns associated with phishing attempts.

Features:

1. Scans URLs to check if they are phishing sites.

2. Analyzes domain names, subdomains, and URL structures.

3. Detects suspicious patterns such as shortened URLs, use of HTTPS, and unusual characters.

4. Provides a report with the phishing risk level of the given URL.
